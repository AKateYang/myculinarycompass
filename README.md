IMPORTANT NOTE: A few steps need to be followed anytime the repository is cloned or a new branch is made based on a branch on the github.
  1. In a terminal, run the command, npm install separately in BOTH the frontend and backend folder. 
  2. Then in the backend folder create a .env file with the mongodb string and jwt token.
You can get the mongodb string from the database or ask a member of the team for it. Be sure you use your credientials in the mongodb string. (Also MAKE SURE .env and node_modules/ is listed in the .gitignore file.)

This is a MERN stack web app for COP4331 at UCF
Once the app is cloned, please setup .env file and run the command npm install in the root directory & in frontend directory.
